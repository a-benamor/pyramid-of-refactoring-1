# About the project

This project was made for educational purpose only in order to learn and perform some refactoring techniques to ameliorate the quality of a legacy code.

It is the course project of the [Pyramid of Refactoring (Java) - Cleaning Code Gradually](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-b578c0ca-66f0-4468-9b6a-e5b84f491914/) online course by M Wlodek Krakowski.

During the online course, I have practiced refactoring on a practical example: 
 - Emerge the design pattern Interpreter in the existing code.
 - Emerge the design pattern Factory Method in order to hide the complexity of the object creation.
 - Emerge the design pattern Builder.

I have applied the SOLID principle during refactoring such as: 
- Single responsibility principle.
- Interface Segregation principle.
- Open closed principle.
- Dependency inversion principle.


I have also used IntelliJ shortcuts to extract classes such as: 
- Extract delegate
- Extract Parameter object
- Extract Method object
- And much more...

This code is inspired by Joshua Kerievsky's book "Refactoring to Patterns"

Please note that: 
the module 4-Completed-Interpreter is the last increment of the refactoring in this course.
